Created on Sat Oct  3 13:06:06 2015

Parse results of Google Scholar search for specific terms. Original code from:
@see http://code.activestate.com/recipes/523047-search-google-scholar/#c2
I've updated it to BeautifulSoup4 and current syntax of Google Scholar source.
Also started saving the results in a class object for compatibility with other code.

@author: Alek
@version: 1.0.2
@since: Mon  5 Oct 2015

CHANGELOG:
Sat  3 Oct 2015 - 1.0.0 - Alek - Issued the first version based on a class from the Internet.
Mon  5 Oct 2015 - 1.0.1 - Alek - Now don't try to parse citations.
                - 1.0.2 - Alek - Now convert authors' list to str from Unicode.
